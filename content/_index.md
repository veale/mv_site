Iâ€™m a technology policy researcher at University College London. I research:

* on-the-ground issues and design challenges for fairness, transparency and resilience of high-stakes algorithmic systems, particularly in the public sector;
* machine learning and privacy-enhancing technologies, and their intersection with European data protection law (e.g. the GDPR & ePrivacy);
* administrative and institutional challenges in governing fast-moving, digital technologies.

I previously worked at the [Royal Society as a data governance researcher](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/data-governance/), in [IoT and ageing governance at the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/eip/ageing/home_en), and at [Bonsucro](http://bonsucro.com) as a data scientist. I hold a BSc from [LSE](http://www.lse.ac.uk) and an MSc from [Maastricht University](http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl).

I [tweet too much](http://www.twitter.com/mikarv). Lists of my <a href="/publications/">publications</a> and recent <a href="/talks">talks</a> can be found here.
